## How to get Started with
1. 

## How to Test
1. Due date in timestamp

## Big Assumtion notes
1. We are sending the userId for the create, update and delete task, instead of taking user id from JWT
2. Pagination is skipped due to the task being an assignment

## Things we are ignoring right now, example below
- Seperating APP and Server for easier testing
- Custom Error Classes for throw errors with specific context, format and data
- Creating branches for each feature and then merged in to dev, then mnerging dev to main branch
- Writing Unit test
- Linting and Prettify is being skipped
- Module/path aliasing is being skipped
- Not Implementing AUTH where user id will be fetched from JWT
- DB connection
- There is no detailed validation on all the inputs
- Documentating everything
- Creating API documentation
